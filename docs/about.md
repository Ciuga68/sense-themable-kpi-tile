I have created this visualization extension to make it easy to create themable KPI tiles without having to create a custom visualization extension all the time.

You can create your own themes by just modifying a simple .json file (see below for further explanation).

**Note:**
This extension has some _basic_ built-in logic to be responsive but is by far not that responsive as the native KPI object of Qlik Sense.
